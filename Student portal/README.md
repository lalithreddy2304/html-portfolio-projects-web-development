# Student Portal Website (HTML Only)

This is a simple student portal website made using only HTML.  
It includes all 4 years of information like subjects, timetables, semester exam dates, and faculty contacts — everything in one place.

I created this project as a basic HTML practice to understand how web pages are structured and connected. It’s a single-page site where you can scroll or click navigation links to move between sections easily.
