# HTML Projects

This repository contains a collection of HTML-only projects that I am developing as part of my learning and practice in web development. The primary objective of this repository is to build a strong foundation in HTML before progressing to CSS, JavaScript, and more advanced web technologies.

## Repository Purpose

- To develop and refine core HTML skills through practical project-based learning  
- To understand project structuring, multi-page navigation, and semantic HTML usage  
- To build a portfolio of foundational projects before transitioning into styling and interactivity

## Future Scope

As the learning journey progresses, separate repositories will be created for:  
- HTML + CSS projects  
- JavaScript-based projects  
- Full-stack web development projects  

This repository will remain focused solely on HTML-based implementations.
